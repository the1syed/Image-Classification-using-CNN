# 🖼️ Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is designed to classify images into different categories based on their visual features.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Automatically classify images from a dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or a custom dataset).
- **Approach**: Use deep learning (CNN) to learn patterns and features in images.
- **Model**: A custom CNN built using Keras with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
